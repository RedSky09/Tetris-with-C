This is one of my college project task. I make a Tertris Clone with c, and also using SDL2. 
I also add a pixel font (pixel.ttf) and the tetris song (tetris.wav) to make it better.

You can have it for free.
Make sure you have link SDL2 with your code editor.
Because i add a new font and a song, you must to add SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer library, 
that's for import font and song lib.
